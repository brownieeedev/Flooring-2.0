# Flooring-2.0
This project was created to update my previous flooring project written in HTML, CSS and JS. The application now includes backend with NodeJs front-end with React, and I also used frameworks like Bootstrap, and Material UI. On the website users can ask for offers and take the offers. Behind the scenes on the backend I wrote an application that estimates the days of the flooring work, and gives a calculated price offer, based on the days, the size of the area, and based on the location of the area, and sends out the offers in emails.
The site is available here: http://www.bbflooringlondon.uk
